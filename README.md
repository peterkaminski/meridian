# Meridian - A Time Zone Converter

To convert time zones, go directly to [meridian.html](https://peterkaminski.github.io/meridian/meridian.html).

Meridian is a streamlined, open source time zone converter that runs entirely in your browser as a single HTML and JavaScript file. It instantly generates copyable time listings across multiple time zones, perfect for coordinating across global teams or scheduling international events.

What sets Meridian apart is its use of standard time zone abbreviations (like EST, CEST, AEDT) instead of city names. While you may not recognize every abbreviation globally, you'll know your local one instantly. The converter automatically adjusts the abbreviations to reflect daylight savings time, summer time, or standard time based on the selected date and time, even if the switches happen on different days in different time zones.

The current version is already useful, but it's missing a key feature, the ability to easily choose which time zones to list. Right now, if you're comfortable editing HTML, you can edit the `cities[]` array in the script section to specify time zones. Later, it will be easy to select time zones directly in your web browser.
